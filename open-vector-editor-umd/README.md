# open-vector-editor-umd

The open-vector-editor-umd package contains only the UMD files of [open-vector-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-vector-editor).

[Open Vector Editor](https://github.com/TeselaGen/openVectorEditor) is Teselagen's Open Source Vector/Plasmid Editor Component that uses React and Redux. It is published as [open-vector-editor in the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-vector-editor). However, if your project does not use React and Redux, open-vector-editor will add a lot of dependencies.

Fortunately, open-vector-editor also has a universal build (Universal Module Definition, UMD).

The files are republish as they are without further testing.
If you have problems with Open Vector Editor please seek help from the OVE developers at https://github.com/TeselaGen/openVectorEditor.
